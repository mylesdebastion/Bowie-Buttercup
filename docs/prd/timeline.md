## 3. Critical Path Analysis

### 3.1 Week 1 Critical Path

**Sequence**: Game.js → Canvas.js → InputManager.js → Integration Testing

**Risk**: Game loop timing changes affecting performance
**Mitigation**: Continuous performance monitoring and baseline comparison

**Dependencies**:
- Vite configuration must complete before module extraction
- Game.js depends on Canvas.js for rendering context
- InputManager.js depends on Game.js for event handling

### 3.2 Week 2 Critical Path

**Sequence**: Entity Base Class → Player.js → Physics.js → Entity Integration

**Risk**: Physics behavior changes affecting game feel
**Mitigation**: Side-by-side comparison testing with original implementation

**Dependencies**:
- Player.js depends on Entity base class interface
- Physics.js must be extracted before secondary entities
- All entities depend on Physics.js for collision detection

### 3.3 Week 3 Critical Path

**Sequence**: LevelManager.js → Individual Levels → UI Components → Final Integration

**Risk**: Level-specific mechanics breaking during extraction
**Mitigation**: Level-by-level validation with original implementation

**Dependencies**:
- Individual levels depend on LevelManager.js interface
- UI components depend on core game systems
- Final integration depends on all previous systems

## 6. Contingency Plans

### 6.1 Buffer and Contingency

**Built-in Buffers**:
- 20% time buffer built into each week for unexpected issues
- Day 5, 10, and 15 reserved for testing and problem resolution
- Parallel work streams where possible to absorb delays

**Contingency Plans**:
- **Major Technical Blocker**: Revert to previous week's stable state
- **Performance Issues**: Dedicated optimization sprint before next phase
- **Integration Problems**: Feature flag rollback to monolithic system
- **Timeline Pressure**: Scope reduction with core functionality prioritized

### 6.2 Success Recovery Plans

**Week 1 Delays**:
- **Option 1**: Extend Week 1 by 2 days, compress Week 3 non-critical tasks
- **Option 2**: Reduce scope to core Game and Canvas extraction only
- **Decision Point**: Thursday of Week 1 based on progress assessment

**Week 2 Delays**:
- **Option 1**: Simplify entity extraction, maintain Player.js as priority
- **Option 2**: Defer complex entity behaviors to post-modularization
- **Decision Point**: Wednesday of Week 2 based on entity testing results

**Week 3 Delays**:
- **Option 1**: Prioritize level functionality over UI modularization
- **Option 2**: Deploy with simplified UI components, enhance post-deployment
- **Decision Point**: Tuesday of Week 3 based on integration test results
