## Technical Architecture

### Workflow Orchestration
```typescript
interface WorkflowStage {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  trigger: WorkflowTrigger;
  actions: WorkflowAction[];
  conditions: WorkflowCondition[];
  nextStages: string[];
}

const projectWorkflow: WorkflowStage[] = [
  {
    id: 'order_received',
    name: 'Order Processing',
    trigger: { type: 'order_submitted' },
    actions: [
      'createProject',
      'assignArtist',
      'sendWelcomeEmail',
      'createAssetFolders'
    ],
    conditions: [
      'orderValid',
      'artistAvailable',
      'paymentConfirmed'
    ],
    nextStages: ['pixel_art_creation']
  },
  {
    id: 'pixel_art_creation',
    name: 'Pixel Art Development',
    trigger: { type: 'project_assigned' },
    actions: [
      'notifyArtist',
      'scheduleDeadline',
      'trackProgress'
    ],
    conditions: [
      'assetsUploaded',
      'configurationComplete'
    ],
    nextStages: ['game_generation']
  },
  // Additional stages...
];
```

### Event-Driven Architecture
```typescript
interface WorkflowEvent {
  type: string;
  projectId: string;
  userId: string;
  timestamp: Date;
  data: Record<string, any>;
}

class WorkflowOrchestrator {
  async processEvent(event: WorkflowEvent): Promise<void> {
    const project = await this.getProject(event.projectId);
    const currentStage = await this.getCurrentStage(project);
    const applicableActions = this.getActionsForEvent(currentStage, event);
    
    for (const action of applicableActions) {
      await this.executeAction(action, project, event);
    }
    
    await this.evaluateStageTransition(project, event);
  }
  
  private async executeAction(
    action: WorkflowAction, 
    project: Project, 
    event: WorkflowEvent
  ): Promise<void> {
    switch (action.type) {
      case 'send_notification':
        await this.notificationService.send(action.config, project);
        break;
      case 'update_status':
        await this.projectService.updateStatus(project.id, action.config.status);
        break;
      case 'assign_reviewer':
        await this.assignmentService.assignReviewer(project.id, action.config);
        break;
      // Additional actions...
    }
  }
}
```

## Quality Assurance Integration

### Automated Quality Checks
```typescript
const qualityChecks = {
  asset_validation: {
    images: [
      'validateFormat', // PNG/JPG/WebP
      'checkDimensions', // Correct sprite sizes
      'validateTransparency', // Alpha channel handling
      'optimizeFileSize', // Compression standards
      'scanForIssues' // Corruption, artifacts
    ],
    audio: [
      'validateFormat', // MP3/WAV support
      'checkBitrate', // Quality standards
      'validateDuration', // Length requirements
      'normalizeVolume', // Consistent audio levels
      'detectSilence' // Remove dead air
    ]
  },
  
  game_validation: {
    technical: [
      'validateBundleSize', // <2MB requirement
      'checkPerformance', // 60 FPS target
      'testMobileControls', // Touch functionality
      'validateOfflineMode', // No external dependencies
      'checkCompatibility' // Cross-browser support
    ],
    gameplay: [
      'testGameMechanics', // Physics working correctly
      'validateLevelProgression', // Proper difficulty curve
      'checkUIElements', // All buttons functional
      'testEndConditions', // Win/lose scenarios
      'validateAssetLoading' // All assets display correctly
    ]
  }
};
```
