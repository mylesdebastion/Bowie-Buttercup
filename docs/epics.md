## Epic 1: Vanity URL Game Delivery

**Slug:** vanity-url

### Goal

Enable personalized game delivery at unique URLs (sparkleclassic.com/petname) by adding config injection to the monolithic game and creating a simple generation/deployment workflow.

### Scope

- Add GAME_CONFIG injection point to monolithic index.html
- Modify sprite loading to read from config instead of hardcoded paths
- Create generation script to produce per-customer games
- Deploy static files to Vercel/Netlify
- Document process for Aurelia to deploy new games

### Success Criteria

1. Games load correct sprites based on injected config
2. Vanity URLs resolve to personalized games
3. Aurelia can deploy a new customer game within 15 minutes
4. Games remain offline-capable and <2MB

### Dependencies

- Working monolithic game (index.html on main branch) ✅
- Pet sprite assets (Bowie, Buttercup exist) ✅
- Domain sparkleclassic.com (owned) ✅
- Hosting account (Vercel free tier) - to be set up

## Stories - Epic 1

### Story 1.1: Config Injection and Vanity URL Deployment

As a **business owner (Myles/Aurelia)**,
I want **to deliver personalized games at unique URLs**,
So that **customers receive their custom pet game and we can validate the business model**.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

**Given** a customer named "fluffy" with sprite assets ready
**When** running `node scripts/generate-game.js fluffy`
**Then** a playable game is generated at `games/fluffy/index.html` with Fluffy's sprites

**And** deploying to Vercel makes the game accessible at `sparkleclassic.com/fluffy/`

**And** the game works offline after initial load

**And** Aurelia can complete the entire process in under 15 minutes

**Prerequisites:** None (first story)

**Technical Notes:** See tech-spec.md for detailed implementation guidance including line numbers and code samples.
