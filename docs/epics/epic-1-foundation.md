# Epic 1: Core Architecture Setup

**Epic ID**: EPIC-001  
**Epic Goal**: Establish modular foundation with build system  
**Business Value**: Enable modern development workflow and create foundation for all future modularization work  
**Story Points**: 21  
**Duration**: Week 1 (5 days)  

## Epic Overview

This epic establishes the foundational architecture for modularizing the Cat Platformer game. It focuses on setting up modern development tooling, extracting core game systems, and creating the base infrastructure that all other modularization work will build upon.

## Success Criteria

- Modern build system operational with hot reload
- Core game loop extracted to modular architecture
- Canvas and input management separated into independent modules
- 100% functional parity with original monolithic version
- Developer productivity improvements measurable
