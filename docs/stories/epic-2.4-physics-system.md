# US-009: Physics System Module

**Story ID**: US-009  
**Epic**: [Epic 2: Entity System Modularization](../epics/epic-2-entity-system.md)  
**Story Points**: 5  
**Priority**: Critical  
**Sprint**: Week 2, Day 4  

## User Story

**As a** developer  
**I want** the physics system separated into its own module  
**So that** collision detection is testable, maintainable, and can be enhanced without affecting entity logic  

## Business Value

The physics system is the foundation of gameplay feel. Separating it enables comprehensive testing, optimization, and future enhancements while ensuring collision accuracy that maintains the precise gameplay balance.

## Acceptance Criteria

### AC-001: Collision Detection Accuracy
- **Given** the Physics module handles all collision detection
- **When** entities interact in the game
- **Then** collision detection accuracy matches original within 1 pixel tolerance
- **And** collision responses produce identical gameplay behavior
- **And** edge cases (corner collisions, simultaneous collisions) work correctly

### AC-002: Physics System Performance
- **Given** the modular Physics system is running
- **When** many entities are present and moving
- **Then** physics calculations complete within original timing constraints
- **And** frame rate remains stable at 60 FPS
- **And** collision detection overhead is minimized

### AC-003: Entity Integration Interface
- **Given** entities need physics calculations
- **When** they call physics system methods
- **Then** the API is clean and consistent for all entity types
- **And** physics state is managed independently from entity logic
- **And** collision callbacks work reliably

### AC-004: Extensibility and Testing
- **Given** the Physics system is modular
- **When** new collision scenarios are needed
- **Then** the system can be extended without changing existing behavior
- **And** comprehensive unit tests validate all collision logic
- **And** physics behavior can be tested independently

## Technical Notes

### Physics System Interface
```javascript
class Physics {
  constructor() {
    this.collisionCallbacks = new Map()
  }
  
  // Core collision detection
  checkCollision(entityA, entityB)
  checkPlatformCollision(entity, platforms)
  checkWorldBoundaries(entity, worldBounds)
  
  // Collision response
  resolveCollision(entityA, entityB, collision)
  handlePlatformResponse(entity, platform, collision)
  
  // System management
  registerCollisionCallback(entityTypeA, entityTypeB, callback)
  processCollisions(entities)
  
  // Debugging
  renderCollisionBounds(ctx, entity)
  getCollisionStats()
}
```

### Critical Collision Scenarios to Preserve

**Player-Platform Collisions**:
- Ground detection for jumping/falling
- Wall collision stopping horizontal movement
- Ceiling collision interrupting jumps
- Platform edge behavior

**Player-Entity Collisions**:
- Dog collision affecting player movement/health
- Mouse collision for catching mechanics  
- Fireball collision for player damage/death
- Particle collision (if applicable)

**Entity-Platform Collisions**:
- Fireball collision with platforms (stopping/bouncing)
- Dog bouncing off ground platforms
- Mouse movement confined by platforms

### Performance Requirements
- Collision detection must complete in <2ms for full entity set
- Avoid object allocation during collision checking
- Use efficient spatial partitioning if needed for performance
- Maintain collision accuracy while optimizing for speed

### Collision Detection Accuracy
All collision detection must maintain pixel-perfect accuracy with the original implementation. This is critical for:
- Jump timing and platform precision
- Enemy interaction consistency  
- Gameplay balance preservation
- Player muscle memory compatibility
