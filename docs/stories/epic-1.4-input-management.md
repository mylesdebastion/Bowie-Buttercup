# US-004: Input Management System

**Story ID**: US-004  
**Epic**: [Epic 1: Core Architecture Setup](../epics/epic-1-foundation.md)  
**Story Points**: 4  
**Priority**: High  
**Sprint**: Week 1, Day 4  

## User Story

**As a** developer  
**I want** input handling decoupled from game logic  
**So that** I can support multiple input methods and easily add new control schemes without affecting core game mechanics  

## Business Value

Creates a flexible input system that can support keyboard, touch, and future input methods while maintaining the exact feel and responsiveness of the original game.

## Acceptance Criteria

### AC-001: Unified Input Interface
- **Given** the InputManager is implemented
- **When** input events occur from keyboard or touch
- **Then** they are normalized to a consistent internal format
- **And** game logic receives the same input data regardless of source
- **And** input responsiveness matches the original exactly

### AC-002: Keyboard Input Handling
- **Given** I'm using keyboard controls
- **When** I press movement keys (WASD, arrow keys)
- **Then** the input is captured with identical timing and sensitivity
- **And** key repeat behavior matches original implementation
- **And** all original keyboard shortcuts function correctly

### AC-003: Touch Input Handling
- **Given** I'm using mobile touch controls
- **When** I interact with the D-pad
- **Then** touch events are processed with same responsiveness as original
- **And** multi-touch scenarios are handled appropriately
- **And** touch coordinate mapping is precise

### AC-004: Input State Management
- **Given** the InputManager is processing input
- **When** I query input state
- **Then** current and previous frame input states are available
- **And** input buffering works for precise timing requirements
- **And** input state persists correctly across game state changes

## Technical Tasks

### Task 1: InputManager Architecture
- [ ] Design InputManager class with event-driven architecture
- [ ] Define input event interfaces and data structures
- [ ] Create input state management system
- [ ] Implement input normalization layer

### Task 2: Keyboard Input System
- [ ] Extract keyboard event handling from monolithic code
- [ ] Implement key mapping configuration
- [ ] Handle key down/up states and repeat events
- [ ] Support multiple key binding schemes

### Task 3: Touch Input System
- [ ] Extract mobile D-pad touch handling
- [ ] Implement touch coordinate normalization
- [ ] Handle touch start/move/end events precisely  
- [ ] Support simultaneous touch inputs

### Task 4: Input Buffering and Timing
- [ ] Implement input buffering for frame-perfect timing
- [ ] Create input history for combo/sequence detection
- [ ] Handle input during frame rate variations
- [ ] Ensure consistent input polling frequency

### Task 5: Integration and Testing
- [ ] Integrate InputManager with Game class
- [ ] Test all input scenarios from original game
- [ ] Verify input responsiveness on various devices
- [ ] Implement input debugging and monitoring tools

## Definition of Done

- [ ] InputManager handles all keyboard and touch input identically to original
- [ ] Input responsiveness and timing match original exactly
- [ ] All control schemes (keyboard, mobile D-pad) work perfectly
- [ ] Input state management is robust and efficient
- [ ] Unit tests cover all input scenarios
- [ ] Cross-device testing confirms consistent behavior
- [ ] Integration with Game class is seamless
- [ ] Input debugging tools available for development

## Dependencies

- [US-002: Game Loop Extraction](epic-1.2-game-loop-extraction.md) for integration
- [US-003: Canvas Management Module](epic-1.3-canvas-management.md) for coordinate mapping

## Story Points Breakdown

- InputManager architecture and design: 1 point
- Keyboard input system implementation: 1 point
- Touch input system implementation: 1.5 points
- Integration and testing: 0.5 points

## Testing Strategy

- Unit tests for input event processing and normalization
- Device-specific testing on mobile and desktop
- Input timing and responsiveness regression tests
- Multi-touch scenario testing
- Accessibility testing for keyboard-only navigation
- Performance testing for input processing overhead

## Technical Notes

### Input Events to Handle
```javascript
// Keyboard Events
- keydown/keyup for movement (WASD, arrows)
- keydown for actions (space, enter, escape)
- Special keys (tab for sprite editor, etc.)

// Touch Events  
- touchstart/touchmove/touchend for D-pad
- touch coordinate mapping for precise control
- Multi-touch handling for simultaneous inputs
```

### InputManager Interface
```javascript
class InputManager {
  constructor(canvas)
  
  // Input state queries
  isKeyPressed(key)
  isKeyDown(key) 
  isKeyUp(key)
  getTouchInput()
  
  // Input configuration
  setKeyMapping(action, keys)
  enableTouchControls(enabled)
  
  // Frame-based updates
  update()
  reset()
}
```

### Integration Requirements
- Must work seamlessly with Game class update loop
- Should not require changes to existing game logic
- Must maintain exact timing characteristics of original
- Should support future input methods (gamepad, etc.)
