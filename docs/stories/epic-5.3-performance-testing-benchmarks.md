# US-023: Performance Testing and Benchmarks

**Story ID**: US-023  
**Epic**: [Epic 5: Testing and Quality Assurance](../epics/epic-5-testing-qa.md)  
**Story Points**: 2  
**Priority**: Medium  
**Sprint**: Week 2-3, parallel to development  

## User Story

**As a** developer  
**I want** automated performance testing and benchmarking  
**So that** I can ensure the modular architecture meets performance requirements and detect regressions early  

## Business Value

Performance testing ensures that modularization doesn't degrade the game experience and provides baseline metrics for future optimization efforts.

## Acceptance Criteria

### AC-001: Performance Benchmark Suite
- **Given** performance benchmarks are implemented
- **When** measuring game performance
- **Then** frame rate benchmarks are established and monitored
- **And** memory usage patterns are tracked
- **And** loading time benchmarks are measured

### AC-002: Regression Detection
- **Given** baseline performance metrics exist
- **When** code changes are made
- **Then** performance regressions are automatically detected
- **And** significant performance changes trigger alerts
- **And** performance trends are tracked over time

### AC-003: Cross-Platform Performance
- **Given** performance tests run on multiple platforms
- **When** testing across target browsers and devices
- **Then** performance consistency is verified
- **And** platform-specific performance issues are detected
- **And** mobile device performance is monitored

### AC-004: Performance Reporting
- **Given** performance data is collected
- **When** generating performance reports
- **Then** clear performance metrics are provided
- **And** performance trends are visualized
- **And** actionable performance insights are available
