# US-016: Level Manager and Transitions

**Story ID**: US-016  
**Epic**: [Epic 3: Level System Architecture](../epics/epic-3-level-system.md)  
**Story Points**: 5  
**Priority**: Critical  
**Sprint**: Week 3, Day 2  

## User Story

**As a** developer  
**I want** a centralized Level Manager that handles level loading and transitions  
**So that** level progression is smooth and new levels can be added without changing core game logic  

## Business Value

The Level Manager provides the infrastructure for seamless level transitions and makes it easy to add new levels in the future, while maintaining the exact progression flow players expect.

## Acceptance Criteria

### AC-001: Dynamic Level Loading
- **Given** the Level Manager is implemented
- **When** a level needs to be loaded
- **Then** it dynamically instantiates the correct level class
- **And** level initialization happens without hardcoded references
- **And** level loading is efficient and doesn't cause frame drops

### AC-002: Smooth Level Transitions
- **Given** a level is completed
- **When** transitioning to the next level
- **Then** the transition is smooth and identical to original timing
- **And** level cleanup happens properly before new level loads
- **And** game state is preserved correctly across transitions

### AC-003: Level Progression Management
- **Given** the game progresses through levels
- **When** tracking player progress
- **Then** level completion status is managed correctly
- **And** save/load functionality works with level progression
- **And** level unlocking follows original game rules

### AC-004: Memory and Performance Management
- **Given** levels are loaded and unloaded
- **When** transitioning between levels
- **Then** memory cleanup prevents leaks
- **And** level loading performance is optimal
- **And** entity cleanup between levels is thorough

## Technical Tasks

### Task 1: Level Manager Architecture
- [ ] Design LevelManager class with level registry
- [ ] Create dynamic level loading system
- [ ] Implement level class instantiation and configuration
- [ ] Add level lifecycle management (load, start, cleanup)

### Task 2: Level Transition System
- [ ] Implement smooth level transition mechanics
- [ ] Add level completion detection and handling
- [ ] Create transition timing that matches original
- [ ] Handle level state persistence during transitions

### Task 3: Level Registry and Configuration
- [ ] Create level registry for all 5 levels
- [ ] Implement level metadata and configuration system
- [ ] Add level progression rules and requirements
- [ ] Support future level addition without code changes

### Task 4: Memory Management System
- [ ] Implement thorough level cleanup on transitions
- [ ] Add entity cleanup and memory leak prevention
- [ ] Create resource management for level assets
- [ ] Optimize level loading and unloading performance

### Task 5: Integration and Testing
- [ ] Integrate LevelManager with Game class
- [ ] Test all level transitions and progression paths
- [ ] Verify save/load functionality with level system
- [ ] Test edge cases and error handling scenarios

## Definition of Done

- [ ] LevelManager handles all level loading and transitions smoothly
- [ ] Level progression matches original game flow exactly
- [ ] Memory management prevents leaks during level changes
- [ ] New levels can be added without modifying core game logic
- [ ] Save/load functionality works correctly with level system
- [ ] Unit tests cover level management and transition logic
- [ ] Integration tests verify complete game progression
- [ ] Performance optimized for level loading operations

## Dependencies

- [US-011: Level Base Class and Interface](epic-3.1-level-base-class.md) must be completed
- [US-012: Level 1 Fireball Platformer](epic-3.2-level-1-fireball.md) through [US-015: Level 4 & 5 Dog and Victory](epic-3.5-level-4-5-dog-victory.md)
- [US-005: State Management Foundation](../stories/epic-1.5-state-management.md) for progression saving

## Story Points Breakdown

- Level Manager architecture and loading: 2 points
- Transition system and progression: 2 points
- Memory management and integration: 1 point

## Testing Strategy

- Unit tests for level loading and transition logic
- Integration tests for complete game progression (Level 1-5)
- Memory leak testing during level transitions
- Performance testing for level loading times
- Error handling tests for invalid level states
- Save/load testing with level progression

## Technical Notes

### Level Manager Interface
```javascript
class LevelManager {\n  constructor(game, stateManager, entityManager) {\n    this.game = game\n    this.stateManager = stateManager\n    this.entityManager = entityManager\n    this.currentLevel = null\n    this.levelRegistry = new Map()\n    this.transitionInProgress = false\n    \n    this.registerLevels()\n  }\n  \n  // Level management\n  loadLevel(levelId) {}\n  getCurrentLevel() {}\n  completeCurrentLevel() {}\n  \n  // Level progression\n  goToNextLevel() {}\n  goToPreviousLevel() {}\n  goToLevel(levelId) {}\n  \n  // Level registration\n  registerLevel(id, levelClass, config) {}\n  getLevelInfo(levelId) {}\n  \n  // State management\n  saveProgress() {}\n  loadProgress() {}\n  resetProgress() {}\n  \n  // Transitions\n  startTransition(fromLevel, toLevel) {}\n  completeTransition() {}\n}\n```\n\n### Level Registry Configuration\n```javascript\nconst LEVEL_REGISTRY = {\n  'level1': {\n    class: Level1,\n    name: 'Fireball Platformer',\n    unlocked: true,\n    nextLevel: 'level2'\n  },\n  'level2': {\n    class: Level2,\n    name: 'Mouse Catching Arena', \n    unlocked: false,\n    nextLevel: 'level3',\n    requirements: ['level1']\n  },\n  'level3': {\n    class: Level3,\n    name: 'Challenge Arena',\n    unlocked: false, \n    nextLevel: 'level4',\n    requirements: ['level2']\n  },\n  'level4': {\n    class: Level4,\n    name: 'Dog Bouncing Challenge',\n    unlocked: false,\n    nextLevel: 'level5', \n    requirements: ['level3']\n  },\n  'level5': {\n    class: Level5,\n    name: 'Victory Feast',\n    unlocked: false,\n    nextLevel: null,\n    requirements: ['level4']\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### Level Transition Flow\n1. Current level detects completion condition\n2. LevelManager receives completion notification\n3. Current level cleanup() method called\n4. EntityManager clears all entities\n5. Save game progress to StateManager\n6. Next level instantiated and configured\n7. Next level load() method called\n8. Game transitions smoothly to new level\n\n### Performance Requirements\n- Level loading must complete in <500ms\n- Level transitions should be imperceptible to player\n- Memory usage should not grow between level transitions\n- Entity cleanup must prevent memory leaks\n- Transition timing should match original game exactly
