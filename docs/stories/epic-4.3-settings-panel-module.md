# US-019: Settings Panel Module

**Story ID**: US-019  
**Epic**: [Epic 4: UI System Separation](../epics/epic-4-ui-system.md)  
**Story Points**: 3  
**Priority**: Medium  
**Sprint**: Week 3, Day 4  

## User Story

**As a** developer  
**I want** the settings panel separated into its own module  
**So that** game settings can be managed independently and new settings can be easily added  

## Business Value

The settings panel manages accessibility features and user preferences. Modularizing it enables easier addition of new settings while ensuring current accessibility features remain stable.

## Acceptance Criteria

### AC-001: Settings Functionality Preservation
- **Given** the SettingsPanel module is loaded
- **When** I access game settings
- **Then** all original settings work identically (high contrast, reduced motion, mute)
- **And** setting changes apply immediately as before
- **And** visual feedback for setting states is preserved

### AC-002: State Persistence Integration
- **Given** settings are modified
- **When** they are saved and loaded
- **Then** integration with StateManager works correctly
- **And** settings persist across browser sessions
- **And** setting defaults are applied correctly

### AC-003: Accessibility Features
- **Given** accessibility settings are enabled
- **When** they affect game presentation
- **Then** high contrast mode works identically
- **And** reduced motion settings are applied correctly
- **And** audio mute functionality works as expected

### AC-004: Extensible Settings System
- **Given** the settings system is modular
- **When** new settings need to be added
- **Then** the architecture supports easy extension
- **And** new settings integrate with persistence system
- **And** UI layout adapts to additional settings

## Technical Tasks

### Task 1: SettingsPanel Class Design
- [ ] Extract SettingsPanel class from monolithic code
- [ ] Design extensible settings management architecture
- [ ] Create setting definition and validation system
- [ ] Implement settings UI component system

### Task 2: Settings Functionality Implementation
- [ ] Extract high contrast mode toggle and implementation
- [ ] Extract reduced motion setting and effects
- [ ] Extract audio mute functionality
- [ ] Preserve exact setting behavior and visual feedback

### Task 3: State Management Integration
- [ ] Connect settings with StateManager for persistence
- [ ] Implement settings serialization and validation
- [ ] Add settings change propagation system
- [ ] Test settings persistence across browser sessions

### Task 4: UI Rendering System
- [ ] Extract settings panel rendering code
- [ ] Implement settings control UI components
- [ ] Add settings panel show/hide functionality
- [ ] Ensure visual appearance matches original exactly

### Task 5: Testing and Extensibility
- [ ] Test all existing settings functionality
- [ ] Verify accessibility feature integration
- [ ] Test settings persistence and loading
- [ ] Validate architecture supports new settings addition

## Definition of Done

- [ ] SettingsPanel module provides all original functionality
- [ ] All accessibility settings work identically
- [ ] Settings persistence integrates correctly with StateManager
- [ ] Settings UI appearance matches original exactly
- [ ] Architecture supports easy addition of new settings
- [ ] Unit tests cover settings functionality
- [ ] Integration tests verify settings persistence
- [ ] Accessibility testing confirms feature preservation

## Dependencies

- [US-005: State Management Foundation](../stories/epic-1.5-state-management.md) for settings persistence
- [US-003: Canvas Management Module](../stories/epic-1.3-canvas-management.md) for high contrast rendering
- Understanding of original settings implementation and accessibility features

## Story Points Breakdown

- SettingsPanel extraction and architecture: 1.5 points
- Settings functionality and persistence: 1 point
- Testing and extensibility validation: 0.5 points

## Testing Strategy

- Unit tests for settings management and validation
- Integration tests for StateManager persistence
- Accessibility testing for high contrast and reduced motion
- Settings persistence testing across browser sessions
- UI interaction testing for all settings controls
- Extensibility testing with mock new settings
