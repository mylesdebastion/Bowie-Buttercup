# US-028: Performance Monitoring Integration

**Story ID**: US-028  
**Epic**: [Epic 6: Performance and Optimization](../epics/epic-6-performance-optimization.md)  
**Story Points**: 1  
**Priority**: Low  
**Sprint**: Week 3, Day 5  

## User Story

**As a** developer  
**I want** integrated performance monitoring and alerting  
**So that** performance regressions are detected early and optimization opportunities are identified  

## Business Value

Performance monitoring provides ongoing visibility into game performance, enabling proactive optimization and early detection of performance issues.

## Acceptance Criteria

### AC-001: Performance Metrics Collection
- **Given** performance monitoring is integrated
- **When** the game is running
- **Then** key performance metrics are collected automatically
- **And** frame rate, memory usage, and loading times are tracked
- **And** performance data is available for analysis

### AC-002: Performance Dashboard
- **Given** performance monitoring is active
- **When** accessing performance data
- **Then** a clear performance dashboard shows current metrics
- **And** historical performance trends are visible
- **And** performance comparisons with baselines are available

### AC-003: Performance Alerting
- **Given** performance thresholds are configured
- **When** performance degrades below acceptable levels
- **Then** automated alerts notify developers of issues
- **And** performance regressions are detected quickly
- **And** actionable performance insights are provided

### AC-004: Development Integration
- **Given** performance monitoring is integrated into development workflow
- **When** developing new features
- **Then** performance impact is measured and reported
- **And** performance feedback is available during development
- **And** performance optimization decisions are data-driven
