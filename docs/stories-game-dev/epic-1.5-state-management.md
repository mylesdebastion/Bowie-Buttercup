# US-005: State Management Foundation

**Story ID**: US-005  
**Epic**: [Epic 1: Core Architecture Setup](../epics-game-dev/epic-e001-foundation.md)  
**Story Points**: 4  
**Priority**: Medium  
**Sprint**: Week 1, Day 5  

## User Story

**As a** developer  
**I want** centralized state management for game data and settings  
**So that** all modules can share state consistently and player progress is reliably persisted  

## Business Value

Provides a robust foundation for data consistency across modules while maintaining the exact save/load behavior that players expect from the original game.

## Acceptance Criteria

### AC-001: Centralized State Management
- **Given** the StateManager is implemented
- **When** any module needs to access or modify game state
- **Then** it uses the StateManager interface exclusively
- **And** state changes are consistent across all modules
- **And** state validation prevents corruption

### AC-002: Local Storage Persistence  
- **Given** the player makes progress in the game
- **When** they close and reopen the browser
- **Then** their progress is restored exactly as in the original
- **And** all settings (high contrast, mute, etc.) are preserved
- **And** corruption handling gracefully resets to defaults if needed

### AC-003: State Synchronization
- **Given** multiple modules are using game state
- **When** one module updates state
- **Then** other modules are notified of changes appropriately
- **And** state consistency is maintained during updates
- **And** race conditions are prevented

### AC-004: State Validation and Recovery
- **Given** invalid state data is encountered
- **When** the StateManager loads the data
- **Then** it validates all state properties
- **And** corrupted data is handled gracefully
- **And** appropriate defaults are applied for missing data

## Technical Tasks

### Task 1: StateManager Architecture
- [ ] Design StateManager class with event-driven updates
- [ ] Define state schema and validation rules
- [ ] Create state change notification system
- [ ] Implement state immutability patterns

### Task 2: Local Storage Integration
- [ ] Extract existing localStorage logic from monolithic code
- [ ] Implement robust serialization/deserialization
- [ ] Add error handling for storage quota and corruption
- [ ] Create backup and recovery mechanisms

### Task 3: Game State Structure
- [ ] Define comprehensive game state schema
- [ ] Extract current level, player progress, and settings
- [ ] Implement state versioning for future migrations
- [ ] Create state validation and sanitization

### Task 4: Module Integration
- [ ] Create state subscription system for modules
- [ ] Implement state change broadcasting
- [ ] Design clean API for state access and mutations  
- [ ] Add debugging tools for state inspection

### Task 5: Testing and Validation
- [ ] Create comprehensive state management tests
- [ ] Test localStorage edge cases and quota limits
- [ ] Verify state persistence across browser sessions
- [ ] Test state corruption recovery scenarios

## Definition of Done

- [ ] StateManager handles all game state consistently
- [ ] Local storage persistence works identically to original
- [ ] All settings and progress are saved and restored correctly
- [ ] State validation prevents corruption and handles errors gracefully
- [ ] Module integration API is clean and well-documented
- [ ] Unit tests cover all state management scenarios
- [ ] Cross-browser storage compatibility verified
- [ ] Performance impact is negligible

## Dependencies

- [US-002: Game Loop Extraction](epic-1.2-game-loop-extraction.md) for integration points
- Understanding of original localStorage implementation

## Story Points Breakdown

- StateManager architecture and design: 1.5 points
- Local storage integration: 1 point
- State schema and validation: 1 point
- Module integration and testing: 0.5 points

## Testing Strategy

- Unit tests for state operations and validation
- localStorage edge case testing (quota, corruption, disabled)
- Cross-browser storage compatibility tests
- State persistence integration tests
- Performance testing for large state objects
- Recovery scenario testing with corrupted data

## Technical Notes

### Original State Data to Preserve
```javascript
// Game Progress
- currentLevel: number
- levelsCompleted: boolean[]
- playerStats: object

// Settings  
- highContrast: boolean
- reducedMotion: boolean
- musicMuted: boolean
- sfxMuted: boolean

// Sprite Editor
- customSprites: object[]
- selectedSprite: string
```

### StateManager Interface
```javascript
class StateManager {
  constructor()
  
  // State access
  get(key)
  set(key, value)
  getState()
  setState(newState)
  
  // Persistence
  save()
  load()
  clear()
  
  // Change notifications
  subscribe(callback)
  unsubscribe(callback)
  
  // Validation
  validate(state)
  sanitize(state)
}
```

### Integration Patterns
- Event-driven state updates for loose coupling
- Immutable state updates to prevent bugs
- Validation at state boundaries
- Graceful degradation when localStorage unavailable
