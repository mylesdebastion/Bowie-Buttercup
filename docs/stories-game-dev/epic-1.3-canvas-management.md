# US-003: Canvas Management Module

**Story ID**: US-003  
**Epic**: [Epic 1: Core Architecture Setup](../epics-game-dev/epic-e001-foundation.md)  
**Story Points**: 3  
**Priority**: High  
**Sprint**: Week 1, Day 3  

## User Story

**As a** developer  
**I want** Canvas management separated into its own module  
**So that** I can reuse rendering utilities and maintain clean separation between game logic and rendering infrastructure  

## Business Value

Provides reusable rendering infrastructure that other modules can leverage, improving code organization and enabling more sophisticated rendering features in the future.

## Acceptance Criteria

### AC-001: Canvas Utilities Module
- **Given** I need to render game content
- **When** I use the Canvas.js module
- **Then** it provides all necessary canvas context management
- **And** scaling and resolution handling works identically to original
- **And** rendering utilities are available for all game systems

### AC-002: Responsive Design Preservation
- **Given** the Canvas module is implemented  
- **When** I resize the browser window or rotate mobile device
- **Then** the game canvas scales appropriately
- **And** aspect ratio is maintained correctly
- **And** touch/click coordinates map properly to game coordinates

### AC-003: Accessibility Features
- **Given** the Canvas module handles rendering
- **When** accessibility settings are enabled
- **Then** high contrast mode works identically to original
- **And** reduced motion settings are respected
- **And** screen reader compatibility is maintained

### AC-004: Performance Characteristics  
- **Given** the modular Canvas system is active
- **When** I measure rendering performance
- **Then** frame rate equals or exceeds original performance
- **And** memory usage for canvas operations is comparable
- **And** rendering operations are efficiently batched

## Technical Tasks

### Task 1: Canvas Module Design
- [ ] Design Canvas class with clear public API
- [ ] Extract canvas setup and configuration code
- [ ] Create utility methods for common rendering operations
- [ ] Define interface for integration with Game class

### Task 2: Rendering Context Management
- [ ] Implement canvas context creation and management
- [ ] Extract scaling and viewport calculations
- [ ] Handle pixel density for high-DPI displays
- [ ] Manage canvas resizing and aspect ratio preservation

### Task 3: Coordinate System Utilities
- [ ] Extract coordinate transformation utilities
- [ ] Implement screen-to-game coordinate mapping
- [ ] Handle mobile touch coordinate translation
- [ ] Create viewport and camera utility functions

### Task 4: Accessibility Integration
- [ ] Extract high contrast rendering implementation
- [ ] Implement reduced motion support for canvas effects
- [ ] Ensure proper focus management for canvas element
- [ ] Maintain keyboard navigation compatibility

### Task 5: Performance Optimization
- [ ] Implement efficient rendering state management
- [ ] Create rendering batching utilities
- [ ] Optimize canvas operations for smooth 60 FPS
- [ ] Add performance monitoring for canvas operations

## Definition of Done

- [ ] Canvas.js module provides complete rendering infrastructure
- [ ] All original canvas functionality preserved exactly
- [ ] Responsive design works identically across all devices
- [ ] Accessibility features function without regression
- [ ] Performance benchmarks meet or exceed original
- [ ] Unit tests cover all public API methods
- [ ] Integration tests verify compatibility with Game class
- [ ] Documentation complete with usage examples

## Dependencies

- [US-002: Game Loop Extraction](epic-1.2-game-loop-extraction.md) should be in progress
- Understanding of original canvas implementation details

## Story Points Breakdown

- Canvas module architecture: 1 point
- Rendering context and utilities: 1 point  
- Responsive design and accessibility: 1 point

## Testing Strategy

- Unit tests for all Canvas utility methods
- Cross-browser rendering consistency tests
- Mobile device scaling and touch coordinate tests
- Accessibility feature regression tests
- Performance benchmarks for rendering operations
- Visual regression tests using screenshot comparison

## Technical Notes

### Original Canvas Features to Preserve
- Canvas element creation and DOM integration
- 2D rendering context configuration
- Pixel-perfect rendering at various zoom levels
- Mobile-responsive scaling with touch support
- High contrast mode color adjustments
- Smooth animation capabilities at 60 FPS

### Rendering Utilities to Implement
```javascript
class Canvas {
  constructor(containerId, width, height)
  getContext()
  resize(width, height)
  setHighContrast(enabled)
  screenToGame(screenX, screenY)
  gameToScreen(gameX, gameY)
  clear()
  save()
  restore()
}
```

### Integration Pattern
The Canvas module should integrate seamlessly with the Game class while remaining independent enough for future renderer swapping (e.g., WebGL, Phaser integration).
