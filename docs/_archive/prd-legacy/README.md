## Project Summary

### What We're Building
Transform the Cat Platformer from a monolithic 3,400+ line HTML file into a maintainable, modular architecture using vanilla JavaScript and ES6 modules, while preserving 100% backward compatibility.

### Why It Matters
- **60% reduction** in feature development time
- **80% reduction** in bug introduction rate
- Enable parallel development by multiple team members
- Foundation for future framework adoption (Phaser 3)

### Success Criteria
1. All 5 game levels function identically to original
2. Performance metrics meet or exceed original benchmarks
3. Test coverage exceeds 80%
4. Development team satisfaction >8/10

### Timeline
**3 weeks total**:
- Week 1: Foundation architecture (build system, core game loop)
- Week 2: Entity system modularization (player, entities, physics)
- Week 3: Level and UI systems (levels, sprite editor, controls)

## Document Maintenance

### Version Control
- Each document maintains its own version history
- Cross-references updated when related documents change
- Major architectural decisions trigger document updates

### Review Process
- Weekly document reviews during active development
- Monthly reviews post-deployment
- All changes require approval from designated document owner

### Related Documentation
- [Architecture Documents](../architecture/) - Technical system design
- [User Stories](../stories/) - Detailed development tasks
- [Epics](../epics/) - High-level feature groupings
