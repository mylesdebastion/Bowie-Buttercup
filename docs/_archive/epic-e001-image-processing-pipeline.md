## Technical Implementation Notes

### Key Technologies
- **Backend:** Node.js + Express + Sharp for image processing
- **AI Services:** Remove.bg API with U2Net fallback
- **Storage:** AWS S3 or compatible object storage
- **Queue:** Redis-based job queue for processing
- **Frontend:** React with drag-drop and camera integration

### API Endpoints
```
POST /api/images/upload
POST /api/images/remove-background  
POST /api/images/crop
GET /api/images/{id}/status
DELETE /api/images/{id}
```

### Performance Requirements
- Upload processing: < 5 seconds
- Background removal: < 10 seconds
- Concurrent uploads: 100+ simultaneous
- Storage optimization: WebP compression with fallbacks

### Security Considerations
- File type validation and virus scanning
- Encrypted storage and transmission
- Automatic PII detection and redaction
- GDPR-compliant data retention policies

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Testing
- File validation logic
- Image processing functions
- API endpoint responses
- Error handling scenarios

### Integration Testing  
- End-to-end upload workflow
- AI service integration reliability
- Storage system interaction
- Queue processing validation

### Performance Testing
- Concurrent upload stress testing
- Large file handling validation
- Memory usage optimization
- Processing time benchmarking

## Quality Gates

### Definition of Done
- [ ] All acceptance criteria met
- [ ] Unit test coverage >80%
- [ ] Integration tests passing
- [ ] Performance benchmarks met
- [ ] Security review completed
- [ ] GDPR compliance validated
- [ ] Documentation complete

### Success Metrics
- Background removal accuracy >90%
- Upload success rate >99%
- Processing time <10 seconds average
- User satisfaction >4.0/5.0 rating
- Zero security incidents

## Dependencies

### External Dependencies
- Remove.bg API account and quota
- AWS S3 or storage provider setup
- Redis infrastructure for queues
- SSL certificates for secure upload

### Internal Dependencies
