# US-007: Player Entity Module

**Story ID**: US-007  
**Epic**: [Epic 2: Entity System Modularization](../epics/epic-2-entity-system.md)  
**Story Points**: 8  
**Priority**: Critical  
**Sprint**: Week 2, Days 1-2  

## User Story

**As a** developer  
**I want** the Player character extracted to a separate module  
**So that** I can modify player behavior independently while preserving the exact physics and feel that players expect  

## Business Value

The Player is the core entity that drives the entire game experience. Extracting it properly while maintaining identical behavior is critical for player satisfaction and future feature development.

## Acceptance Criteria

### AC-001: Physics Behavior Preservation
- **Given** the Player module is implemented
- **When** I control the player character
- **Then** movement feels identical to the original (acceleration, jump height, air control)
- **And** collision responses are pixel-perfect matches
- **And** physics constants produce the same gameplay experience

### AC-002: Animation System Preservation  
- **Given** the player is moving in the game
- **When** animations play during movement, jumping, and idle states
- **Then** animation timing matches original exactly
- **And** sprite frame transitions are smooth and identical
- **And** animation state machine behaves consistently

### AC-003: Input Integration
- **Given** the Player module receives input from InputManager
- **When** keyboard or touch inputs are processed
- **Then** player response is immediate and identical to original
- **And** input buffering works for precise movement
- **And** control schemes feel unchanged

### AC-004: State Management Integration
- **Given** the player interacts with game systems
- **When** player state needs persistence or sharing
- **Then** integration with StateManager is seamless
- **And** player state updates propagate correctly
- **And** save/load functionality preserves player data

## Technical Tasks

### Task 1: Player Class Architecture

- [ ] Preserve air control and friction characteristics

### Task 3: Animation System Integration

- [ ] Connect animations to movement states
- [ ] Ensure frame timing matches original exactly

### Task 4: Collision Integration
- [ ] Implement collision detection interfaces
- [ ] Extract collision response behaviors
- [ ] Handle platform collision (ground, walls, ceiling)
- [ ] Implement entity interaction collision logic

### Task 5: Input Processing
- [ ] Integrate with InputManager for movement commands
- [ ] Process keyboard and touch input consistently
- [ ] Implement input buffering for precise controls
- [ ] Handle input state changes during gameplay

### Task 6: Testing and Validation
- [ ] Create comprehensive Player behavior tests
- [ ] Implement physics regression tests
- [ ] Test animation timing and state transitions
- [ ] Validate collision accuracy and response

## Definition of Done

- [ ] Player module functions identically to original implementation
- [ ] All movement physics preserve exact game feel
- [ ] Animation system works without visual regression
- [ ] Input integration maintains original responsiveness
- [ ] Collision detection accuracy within 1px tolerance
- [ ] Unit tests achieve 90% coverage for Player class
- [ ] Integration tests verify Player works with all systems
- [ ] Performance benchmarks equal or exceed original

## Dependencies

- [US-006: Entity Base Class Architecture](epic-2.1-entity-base-class.md) must be completed
- [US-004: Input Management System](../stories/epic-1.4-input-management.md) for input integration
- Physics constants and behavior documentation from original code

## Story Points Breakdown

- Player class architecture and extraction: 2 points
- Movement physics implementation: 2.5 points
- Animation system integration: 1.5 points
- Input processing and collision: 1.5 points
- Testing and validation: 0.5 points

## Testing Strategy

- Unit tests for all Player methods and physics calculations
- Integration tests with InputManager and StateManager
- Physics regression tests comparing movement distances/timing
- Animation frame timing verification
- Cross-browser player behavior consistency tests
- Performance testing for Player update/render cycles

## Technical Notes

### Player Physics Constants (Must Preserve Exactly)
```javascript
const PLAYER_CONSTANTS = {
  WALK_SPEED: 4,
  RUN_SPEED: 6,
  JUMP_POWER: 12,
  GRAVITY: 0.8,
  FRICTION: 0.85,
  AIR_FRICTION: 0.95,
  MAX_FALL_SPEED: 15
}
```

### Player State Machine
```javascript
const PLAYER_STATES = {
  IDLE: 'idle',
  WALKING: 'walking',
  RUNNING: 'running', 
  JUMPING: 'jumping',
  FALLING: 'falling',
  LANDING: 'landing'
}
```

### Critical Behaviors to Test
- Jump height consistency across different frame rates
- Wall collision stopping behavior
- Ground detection and landing
- Animation synchronization with movement
- Input lag and responsiveness
- Collision with other entities (Dog, Mouse, Fireball)

### Performance Requirements
- Player update() must complete in <0.5ms on target devices
- Animation frame updates should not cause frame drops
- Memory allocation during movement should be minimal
