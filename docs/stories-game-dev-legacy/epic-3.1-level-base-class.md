# US-011: Level Base Class and Interface

**Story ID**: US-011  
**Epic**: [Epic 3: Level System Architecture](../epics/epic-3-level-system.md)  
**Story Points**: 3  
**Priority**: High  
**Sprint**: Week 3, Day 1  

## User Story

**As a** developer  
**I want** a standardized Level base class and interface  
**So that** all levels share consistent behavior and can be managed uniformly by the level system  

## Business Value

Creates a consistent foundation for all levels, reducing code duplication and making it easy to add new levels in the future while ensuring proper integration with the game engine.

## Acceptance Criteria

### AC-001: Level Base Class Interface
- **Given** the Level base class is implemented
- **When** any level is created
- **Then** it inherits from the Level base class
- **And** it implements required methods (load, update, render, cleanup)
- **And** it has consistent lifecycle management

### AC-002: Level Configuration System  
- **Given** levels need different configurations
- **When** a level is initialized
- **Then** it can specify platforms, spawn points, and win conditions
- **And** level-specific constants are properly encapsulated
- **And** configuration is validated and applied correctly

### AC-003: Level State Management
- **Given** a level is active
- **When** it needs to track progress and state
- **Then** level state is managed consistently
- **And** win/lose conditions are handled uniformly
- **And** level completion status is tracked properly

### AC-004: Integration Points
- **Given** the Level base class exists
- **When** it integrates with game systems
- **Then** entity management integration is clean
- **And** rendering integration maintains performance
- **And** input handling works consistently across levels

## Technical Tasks

### Task 1: Level Base Class Design
- [ ] Design Level base class interface and abstract methods
- [ ] Define common properties (platforms, entities, boundaries)
- [ ] Create standardized lifecycle methods
- [ ] Implement shared utility methods

### Task 2: Level Configuration Framework
- [ ] Create level configuration data structure
- [ ] Implement platform definition system
- [ ] Add spawn point and boundary management
- [ ] Create win condition framework

### Task 3: Level State Management
- [ ] Implement level state tracking
- [ ] Create progress monitoring system
- [ ] Add win/lose condition evaluation
- [ ] Handle level completion state

### Task 4: Entity Integration System
- [ ] Define entity spawning and management interfaces
- [ ] Create level-specific entity configuration
- [ ] Implement entity cleanup on level transitions
- [ ] Add entity interaction management

### Task 5: Testing and Documentation
- [ ] Create comprehensive unit tests for base class
- [ ] Write detailed API documentation
- [ ] Create level implementation guidelines
- [ ] Test integration with entity and game systems

## Definition of Done

- [ ] Level base class provides complete foundation for all level types
- [ ] Level configuration system is flexible and extensible
- [ ] Level state management is robust and consistent
- [ ] Integration with game systems is seamless
- [ ] Unit tests achieve 95% coverage
- [ ] API documentation is complete with examples
- [ ] Level implementation guidelines created
- [ ] Base class ready for individual level implementation

## Dependencies

- [Epic 2: Entity System Modularization](../epics/epic-2-entity-system.md) must be completed
- Understanding of all 5 levels' requirements and mechanics

## Story Points Breakdown

- Level base class architecture: 1.5 points
- Configuration and state management: 1 point
- Integration and testing: 0.5 points

## Testing Strategy

- Unit tests for all base class methods and properties
- Integration tests with Entity and Game systems
- Configuration validation tests
- Level lifecycle tests (load, run, cleanup)
- Performance tests for level operations

## Technical Notes

### Level Base Class Interface
```javascript
class Level {
  constructor(config = {}) {
    this.config = config
    this.platforms = []
    this.entities = []
    this.spawnPoint = { x: 0, y: 0 }
    this.boundaries = { width: 800, height: 600 }
    this.completed = false
    this.active = false
  }
  
  // Abstract methods (must be implemented by subclasses)
  load() { throw new Error('Must implement load()') }
  checkWinCondition() { throw new Error('Must implement checkWinCondition()') }
  
  // Standard lifecycle methods
  start() {}
  update(deltaTime) {}
  render(ctx, camera) {}
  cleanup() {}
  
  // Shared utility methods
  addPlatform(x, y, width, height) {}
  spawnEntity(type, x, y, config = {}) {}
  removeEntity(entity) {}
  isCompleted() {}
}
```

### Level Configuration Schema
```javascript
const levelConfig = {
  // Basic level properties
  name: 'Level Name',
  description: 'Level description',
  
  // Gameplay configuration
  timeLimit: null, // null for no limit, number for seconds
  
  // World boundaries
  boundaries: { width: 800, height: 600 },
  
  // Player spawn point
  spawnPoint: { x: 100, y: 400 },
  
  // Platform definitions
  platforms: [
    { x: 0, y: 550, width: 800, height: 50, type: 'ground' },
    // ... more platforms
  ],
  
  // Entity spawn configurations
  entities: [
    { type: 'fireball', x: 700, y: 200, config: { direction: -1 } },
    // ... more entities
  ],
  
  // Win condition configuration
  winCondition: {
    type: 'reach_area', // 'reach_area', 'collect_items', 'survive_time', etc.
    target: { x: 700, y: 500, width: 50, height: 50 }
  }
}
```

### Design Principles
- Keep base class minimal but complete
- Support different level types (platformer, arena, etc.)
- Maintain consistency with original level behaviors
- Optimize for easy level creation and modification
- Ensure proper cleanup and memory management
