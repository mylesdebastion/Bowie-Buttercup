# US-006: Entity Base Class Architecture

**Story ID**: US-006  
**Epic**: [Epic 2: Entity System Modularization](../epics/epic-2-entity-system.md)  
**Story Points**: 3  
**Priority**: High  
**Sprint**: Week 2, Day 1  

## User Story

**As a** developer  
**I want** a base Entity class with standardized interfaces  
**So that** all game entities share common behavior and can be managed consistently  

## Business Value

Creates a consistent foundation for all entities, reducing code duplication and making it easy to add new entity types in the future.

## Acceptance Criteria

### AC-001: Base Entity Interface
- **Given** the Entity base class is implemented
- **When** I create any game entity
- **Then** it inherits from the Entity base class
- **And** it implements required methods (update, render, onCollision)
- **And** it has consistent lifecycle management

### AC-002: Shared Entity Behavior
- **Given** multiple entities exist in the game
- **When** they interact with core systems
- **Then** they use identical interfaces for positioning, rendering, and collision
- **And** common functionality is inherited from base class
- **And** entity-specific behavior is cleanly separated

### AC-003: Entity Lifecycle Management
- **Given** an entity needs to be created or destroyed
- **When** lifecycle methods are called
- **Then** initialization and cleanup happen consistently
- **And** memory leaks are prevented through proper cleanup
- **And** entity state is managed predictably

### AC-004: Performance Standards
- **Given** the modular entity system is running
- **When** I measure entity update and render performance
- **Then** overhead from base class is negligible (<1% performance impact)
- **And** entity operations are as fast as original implementation
- **And** memory usage patterns are efficient

## Technical Tasks

### Task 1: Entity Base Class Design
- [ ] Design Entity base class interface and abstract methods
- [ ] Define common properties (position, size, velocity, etc.)
- [ ] Create standardized lifecycle methods
- [ ] Implement shared utility methods

### Task 2: Entity State Management
- [ ] Implement entity state tracking (active, destroyed, etc.)
- [ ] Create position and transform management
- [ ] Add bounding box and collision shape handling
- [ ] Design property change notification system

### Task 3: Rendering Interface
- [ ] Define standardized render method signature
- [ ] Implement common rendering utilities
- [ ] Create sprite and animation management base functionality
- [ ] Support different rendering modes (normal, high contrast)

### Task 4: Physics Integration
- [ ] Define physics interaction interfaces
- [ ] Implement collision detection participation
- [ ] Create velocity and acceleration management
- [ ] Add collision response framework

### Task 5: Testing and Documentation
- [ ] Create comprehensive unit tests for base class
- [ ] Write detailed API documentation
- [ ] Create entity implementation guidelines
- [ ] Test performance impact of base class overhead

## Definition of Done

- [ ] Entity base class provides complete foundation for all entity types
- [ ] Common functionality is properly abstracted and reusable
- [ ] Entity lifecycle management is robust and leak-free
- [ ] Performance overhead is negligible
- [ ] Unit tests achieve 95% coverage
- [ ] API documentation is complete with examples
- [ ] Implementation guidelines created for future entities
- [ ] Integration tested with existing entity extraction

## Dependencies

- [US-002: Game Loop Extraction](../stories/epic-1.2-game-loop-extraction.md)
- [US-003: Canvas Management Module](../stories/epic-1.3-canvas-management.md)
- Understanding of all entity types to be extracted

## Story Points Breakdown

- Base class architecture and design: 1.5 points
- Lifecycle and state management: 1 point
- Integration interfaces and testing: 0.5 points

## Testing Strategy

- Unit tests for all base class methods and properties
- Performance benchmarks for base class operations
- Memory leak testing for entity lifecycle
- Integration tests with sample entity implementations
- Cross-browser compatibility testing

## Technical Notes

### Entity Base Class Interface
```javascript
class Entity {
  constructor(x, y, options = {}) {
    this.position = { x, y }
    this.velocity = { x: 0, y: 0 }
    this.size = { width: 0, height: 0 }
    this.active = true
    this.destroyed = false
  }
  
  // Abstract methods (must be implemented by subclasses)
  update(deltaTime, gameState) { throw new Error('Must implement') }
  render(ctx, camera) { throw new Error('Must implement') }
  
  // Optional override methods
  onCollision(other, collisionData) {}
  onDestroy() {}
  
  // Shared utility methods
  getBounds() {}
  setPosition(x, y) {}
  destroy() {}
}
```

### Design Principles
- Keep base class minimal but complete
- Avoid deep inheritance hierarchies
- Prefer composition over inheritance where appropriate
- Maintain compatibility with existing entity logic
- Optimize for performance in update/render loops
