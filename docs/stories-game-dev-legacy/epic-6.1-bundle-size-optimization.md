# US-025: Bundle Size Optimization

**Story ID**: US-025  
**Epic**: [Epic 6: Performance and Optimization](../epics/epic-6-performance-optimization.md)  
**Story Points**: 2  
**Priority**: High  
**Sprint**: Week 3, Day 5  

## User Story

**As a** developer  
**I want** the production bundle optimized for size and loading speed  
**So that** players get faster loading times while maintaining all game functionality  

## Business Value

Optimized bundle size improves user experience through faster loading times while maintaining the complete game functionality that players expect.

## Acceptance Criteria

### AC-001: Bundle Size Target
- **Given** the production bundle is built
- **When** measuring compressed bundle size
- **Then** total bundle size is under 200KB gzipped
- **And** bundle size is equal or smaller than original monolithic version
- **And** all game functionality is preserved

### AC-002: Code Splitting Implementation
- **Given** code splitting is implemented
- **When** the game loads
- **Then** only essential code loads initially
- **And** level-specific code loads dynamically when needed
- **And** loading transitions are smooth and imperceptible

### AC-003: Asset Optimization
- **Given** game assets are optimized
- **When** assets are loaded
- **Then** images and sprites are compressed efficiently
- **And** asset loading doesn't impact gameplay performance
- **And** visual quality is maintained

### AC-004: Loading Performance
- **Given** the optimized bundle is deployed
- **When** measuring loading times
- **Then** initial load time is under 2 seconds on 3G connection
- **And** loading time is equal or better than original
- **And** subsequent level loads are under 500ms
