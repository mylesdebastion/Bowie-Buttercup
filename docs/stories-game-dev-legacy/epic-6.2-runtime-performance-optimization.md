# US-026: Runtime Performance Optimization

**Story ID**: US-026  
**Epic**: [Epic 6: Performance and Optimization](../epics/epic-6-performance-optimization.md)  
**Story Points**: 3  
**Priority**: High  
**Sprint**: Week 3, Day 5  

## User Story

**As a** developer  
**I want** runtime performance optimized to meet or exceed original benchmarks  
**So that** the modular architecture provides smooth 60 FPS gameplay identical to the original experience  

## Business Value

Runtime performance optimization ensures that modularization doesn't degrade the gaming experience while providing a foundation for future performance improvements.

## Acceptance Criteria

### AC-001: Frame Rate Performance
- **Given** the optimized game is running
- **When** measuring frame rate during gameplay
- **Then** consistent 60 FPS is maintained across all levels
- **And** frame rate equals or exceeds original implementation
- **And** no frame drops occur during entity interactions or level transitions

### AC-002: Entity System Performance
- **Given** entities are active in the game
- **When** measuring entity update and render performance
- **Then** entity operations complete within performance budgets
- **And** collision detection maintains original accuracy and speed
- **And** entity management overhead is minimized

### AC-003: Rendering Performance
- **Given** the game is rendering all visual elements
- **When** measuring rendering performance
- **Then** Canvas operations are optimized for efficiency
- **And** rendering batching minimizes draw calls where possible
- **And** visual effects don't impact frame rate

### AC-004: Input Responsiveness
- **Given** input optimization is implemented
- **When** processing user input
- **Then** input lag is minimized to imperceptible levels
- **And** input responsiveness matches original exactly
- **And** input processing doesn't impact frame rate
