# US-024: Cross-Browser Compatibility Testing

**Story ID**: US-024  
**Epic**: [Epic 5: Testing and Quality Assurance](../epics/epic-5-testing-qa.md)  
**Story Points**: 2  
**Priority**: Medium  
**Sprint**: Week 3, during integration phase  

## User Story

**As a** developer  
**I want** automated cross-browser compatibility testing  
**So that** the game works identically across all target browsers and platforms  

## Business Value

Cross-browser testing ensures consistent user experience across all supported platforms and prevents platform-specific issues from reaching production.

## Acceptance Criteria

### AC-001: Target Browser Coverage
- **Given** cross-browser tests are configured
- **When** running compatibility tests
- **Then** Chrome 90+, Firefox 88+, Safari 14+, and Edge 90+ are tested
- **And** both desktop and mobile versions are covered
- **And** game functionality is verified on each platform

### AC-002: Automated Browser Testing
- **Given** browser testing is automated
- **When** tests run in CI/CD pipeline
- **Then** all target browsers are tested automatically
- **And** browser-specific issues are detected early
- **And** test results clearly identify platform problems

### AC-003: Visual Consistency Testing
- **Given** visual regression tests run cross-browser
- **When** comparing rendering across browsers
- **Then** visual appearance is consistent within tolerance
- **And** browser-specific rendering issues are detected
- **And** UI layout problems are identified

### AC-004: Performance Consistency Testing
- **Given** performance tests run cross-browser
- **When** measuring performance across platforms
- **Then** performance consistency is verified
- **And** browser-specific performance issues are detected
- **And** mobile performance is validated

## Technical Tasks

### Task 1: Browser Testing Infrastructure
- [ ] Set up cross-browser testing framework (BrowserStack/Sauce Labs)
- [ ] Configure automated browser testing in CI/CD
- [ ] Create browser testing utilities and helpers
- [ ] Set up mobile device testing capabilities

### Task 2: Functional Compatibility Tests
- [ ] Create game functionality tests for each browser
- [ ] Test input handling across browsers and devices
- [ ] Verify Canvas rendering consistency
- [ ] Test audio and media feature compatibility

### Task 3: Visual Regression Testing
- [ ] Set up visual comparison testing across browsers
- [ ] Create baseline screenshots for each target browser
- [ ] Implement visual difference detection
- [ ] Add visual regression reporting

### Task 4: Performance Compatibility Testing
- [ ] Create performance tests for each browser
- [ ] Test mobile device performance consistency
- [ ] Monitor browser-specific performance characteristics
- [ ] Add performance compatibility reporting

### Task 5: CI/CD Integration
- [ ] Configure automated cross-browser test runs
- [ ] Set up browser testing reporting
- [ ] Add browser compatibility gates to deployment
- [ ] Create browser test result notifications

## Definition of Done

- [ ] All target browsers covered by automated testing
- [ ] Game functionality verified consistent across browsers
- [ ] Visual consistency tested and maintained across platforms
- [ ] Performance compatibility verified for all browsers
- [ ] Browser testing integrated into CI/CD pipeline
- [ ] Clear reporting of browser-specific issues
- [ ] Mobile browser compatibility validated
- [ ] Browser testing prevents incompatible deployments

## Dependencies

- [US-021: Unit Testing Framework](epic-5.1-unit-testing-framework.md) foundation
- [US-022: Integration Testing Suite](epic-5.2-integration-testing-suite.md) for cross-browser integration tests
- Epic 1-4 modules for cross-browser functionality testing
