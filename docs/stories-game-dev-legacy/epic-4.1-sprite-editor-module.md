# US-017: Sprite Editor Module

**Story ID**: US-017  
**Epic**: [Epic 4: UI System Separation](../epics/epic-4-ui-system.md)  
**Story Points**: 5  
**Priority**: Medium  
**Sprint**: Week 3, Day 3  

## User Story

**As a** developer  
**I want** the sprite editor separated into its own module  
**So that** sprite editing functionality can be enhanced independently while preserving the exact user experience  

## Business Value

The sprite editor is a unique feature that allows player customization. Modularizing it enables future enhancements while ensuring the complex editing functionality remains stable.

## Acceptance Criteria

### AC-001: Sprite Editing Functionality
- **Given** the SpriteEditor module is loaded
- **When** I access sprite editing features
- **Then** all original editing tools work identically (draw, erase, color picker)
- **And** sprite preview updates in real-time as before
- **And** file upload and download functionality is preserved

### AC-002: Integration with Game
- **Given** sprites are edited in the editor
- **When** I use them in the game
- **Then** custom sprites appear correctly in gameplay
- **And** sprite data is saved and loaded properly
- **And** integration with game entities works seamlessly

### AC-003: User Interface Preservation
- **Given** the sprite editor UI is modular
- **When** I interact with the interface
- **Then** all buttons, controls, and panels work exactly as original
- **And** visual appearance and layout match perfectly
- **And** keyboard shortcuts and accessibility features work

### AC-004: State Management Integration
- **Given** sprite data needs persistence
- **When** saving and loading sprite configurations
- **Then** integration with StateManager works correctly
- **And** sprite data persists across browser sessions
- **And** sprite editor settings are maintained

## Technical Tasks

### Task 1: SpriteEditor Class Architecture
- [ ] Extract SpriteEditor class from monolithic code
- [ ] Design clean interface for sprite editor functionality
- [ ] Separate sprite editing logic from UI presentation
- [ ] Create modular component structure

### Task 2: Sprite Editing Tools Implementation
- [ ] Extract drawing tools (pencil, eraser, fill)
- [ ] Implement color picker and palette functionality
- [ ] Add sprite canvas management and rendering
- [ ] Preserve exact tool behavior and responsiveness

### Task 3: File Management System
- [ ] Extract sprite file upload/download functionality
- [ ] Implement sprite format validation and processing
- [ ] Add sprite preview and thumbnail generation
- [ ] Create sprite library management

### Task 4: Game Integration
- [ ] Connect sprite editor with game entity system
- [ ] Implement sprite data export for game use
- [ ] Add real-time sprite preview in game context
- [ ] Test sprite usage across all game levels

### Task 5: Testing and Polish
- [ ] Test all sprite editing functionality thoroughly
- [ ] Verify sprite editor UI matches original exactly
- [ ] Test sprite data persistence and loading
- [ ] Performance test sprite editing operations

## Definition of Done

- [ ] SpriteEditor module provides all original functionality
- [ ] Sprite editing tools work identically to original
- [ ] File upload/download features preserved exactly
- [ ] Integration with game systems is seamless
- [ ] Sprite data persistence works correctly
- [ ] UI appearance and behavior match original
- [ ] Performance equals or exceeds original
- [ ] Unit tests cover sprite editor functionality

## Dependencies

- [US-005: State Management Foundation](../stories/epic-1.5-state-management.md) for sprite data persistence
- [US-003: Canvas Management Module](../stories/epic-1.3-canvas-management.md) for rendering utilities
- Understanding of original sprite editor implementation

## Story Points Breakdown

- SpriteEditor extraction and architecture: 2 points
- Editing tools and file management: 2 points
- Integration and testing: 1 point

## Testing Strategy

- Unit tests for sprite editing tool functionality
- Integration tests for sprite editor-game interaction
- File upload/download testing with various formats
- UI interaction testing for all editor controls
- Cross-browser compatibility testing
- Performance testing for large sprite operations
