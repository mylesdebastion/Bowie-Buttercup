# US-014: Level 3 Challenge Arena

**Story ID**: US-014  
**Epic**: [Epic 3: Level System Architecture](../epics/epic-3-level-system.md)  
**Story Points**: 3  
**Priority**: High  
**Sprint**: Week 3, Day 2  

## User Story

**As a** developer  
**I want** Level 3 (Challenge Arena with pits) extracted to its own module  
**So that** the challenge mechanics and pit hazards can be maintained and enhanced independently  

## Business Value

Level 3 provides increased difficulty with environmental hazards. Proper extraction ensures the challenging gameplay balance is preserved while enabling future difficulty adjustments.

## Acceptance Criteria

### AC-001: Challenge Arena Layout
- **Given** Level 3 is loaded
- **When** the player enters the challenge arena
- **Then** platform layout with pits matches original exactly
- **And** pit collision detection works identically (player falls/resets)
- **And** platform jumping mechanics are preserved precisely

### AC-002: Hazard System Implementation  
- **Given** pits and hazards exist in Level 3
- **When** the player interacts with hazards
- **Then** player death/reset behavior matches original
- **And** respawn mechanics work identically
- **And** hazard visual feedback is preserved

### AC-003: Win Condition Implementation
- **Given** the player navigates the challenge arena
- **When** they complete the level objectives
- **Then** level completion detection works correctly
- **And** level transition to Level 4 is smooth
- **And** challenge completion is tracked properly

### AC-004: Level Performance and Balance
- **Given** Level 3 is running with hazards active
- **When** performance and difficulty are measured
- **Then** frame rate maintains 60 FPS with all hazards
- **And** challenge difficulty matches original exactly
- **And** player experience feels identical

## Technical Tasks

### Task 1: Level3 Class Implementation
- [ ] Create Level3 class inheriting from Level base class
- [ ] Extract challenge arena layout from original
- [ ] Define pit locations and hazard zones
- [ ] Implement challenge-specific configuration

### Task 2: Platform and Pit System
- [ ] Implement complex platform layout with gaps
- [ ] Add pit collision detection and player death handling
- [ ] Create respawn system for pit falls
- [ ] Test precise platform jumping requirements

### Task 3: Hazard Management System
- [ ] Configure hazard zones and death triggers
- [ ] Implement player reset/respawn mechanics
- [ ] Add visual indicators for hazardous areas
- [ ] Test hazard interaction accuracy

### Task 4: Win Condition Implementation
- [ ] Define challenge completion requirements
- [ ] Implement progress tracking through difficult sections
- [ ] Add level completion state management  
- [ ] Test level progression to Level 4

### Task 5: Testing and Validation
- [ ] Test complete Level 3 challenge flow
- [ ] Verify hazard behavior matches original exactly
- [ ] Test edge cases for pit collision detection
- [ ] Validate respawn system functionality

## Definition of Done

- [ ] Level 3 functions identically to original implementation
- [ ] Platform layout and pit mechanics work exactly as before
- [ ] Hazard system and respawn mechanics are precise
- [ ] Win condition and level progression work correctly
- [ ] Challenge difficulty maintains original balance
- [ ] Unit tests cover Level 3 specific hazard logic
- [ ] Integration tests verify complete challenge flow
- [ ] Performance optimized for complex level geometry

## Dependencies

- [US-011: Level Base Class and Interface](epic-3.1-level-base-class.md) must be completed
- [US-007: Player Entity Module](../stories/epic-2.2-player-entity.md) for player-hazard interaction
- Understanding of original pit mechanics and respawn system

## Story Points Breakdown

- Level3 class and platform/pit setup: 1.5 points
- Hazard system and respawn mechanics: 1 point
- Win condition and testing: 0.5 points

## Testing Strategy

- Unit tests for pit collision and respawn logic
- Integration tests for complete challenge navigation
- Edge case testing for platform jumping precision
- Hazard interaction accuracy verification
- Performance testing with complex level geometry

## Technical Notes

### Level 3 Configuration
```javascript
const LEVEL3_CONFIG = {
  name: 'Challenge Arena',
  
  boundaries: { width: 800, height: 600 },
  spawnPoint: { x: 50, y: 450 },
  
  platforms: [
    // Starting platform
    { x: 0, y: 500, width: 100, height: 50, type: 'ground' },
    
    // Challenge platforms with gaps (pits)
    { x: 150, y: 450, width: 80, height: 20, type: 'platform' },
    { x: 280, y: 400, width: 60, height: 20, type: 'platform' },
    { x: 400, y: 350, width: 80, height: 20, type: 'platform' },
    { x: 550, y: 300, width: 100, height: 20, type: 'platform' },
    
    // Victory platform
    { x: 700, y: 450, width: 100, height: 50, type: 'victory' }
  ],
  
  // Pit/hazard zones
  hazards: [
    { x: 100, y: 550, width: 50, height: 50, type: 'pit' },
    { x: 230, y: 550, width: 50, height: 50, type: 'pit' },
    { x: 340, y: 550, width: 60, height: 50, type: 'pit' },
    { x: 480, y: 550, width: 70, height: 50, type: 'pit' }
  ],
  
  winCondition: {
    type: 'reach_area',
    target: { x: 700, y: 400, width: 100, height: 100 }
