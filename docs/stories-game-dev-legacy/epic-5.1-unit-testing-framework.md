# US-021: Unit Testing Framework

**Story ID**: US-021  
**Epic**: [Epic 5: Testing and Quality Assurance](../epics/epic-5-testing-qa.md)  
**Story Points**: 4  
**Priority**: High  
**Sprint**: Week 2, parallel to development  

## User Story

**As a** developer  
**I want** a comprehensive unit testing framework  
**So that** all modules can be tested in isolation and refactoring can be done safely  

## Business Value

Unit tests provide the foundation for safe refactoring and ensure individual modules work correctly, enabling confident development and maintenance.

## Acceptance Criteria

### AC-001: Test Framework Setup
- **Given** the Jest testing framework is configured
- **When** I run unit tests
- **Then** all modules can be tested in isolation
- **And** test results are clear and actionable
- **And** code coverage reports are generated

### AC-002: Module Test Coverage
- **Given** unit tests are written for all modules
- **When** measuring test coverage
- **Then** overall coverage is 80% or higher
- **And** critical game mechanics have 95%+ coverage
- **And** all public APIs are fully tested

### AC-003: Mock System Implementation
- **Given** modules have external dependencies
- **When** unit testing individual modules
- **Then** dependencies are properly mocked
- **And** Canvas and DOM interactions are mockable
- **And** tests run without browser dependencies

### AC-004: CI/CD Integration
- **Given** the test suite is complete
- **When** code changes are committed
- **Then** tests run automatically in CI/CD
- **And** failing tests prevent deployment
- **And** test results are reported clearly

## Technical Tasks

### Task 1: Jest Configuration
- [ ] Install and configure Jest testing framework
- [ ] Set up test environment for ES6 modules
- [ ] Configure code coverage reporting
- [ ] Create test script commands

### Task 2: Mock System Setup
- [ ] Create Canvas API mocks for testing
- [ ] Mock DOM APIs and browser features
- [ ] Create test utilities and helpers
- [ ] Set up module mocking patterns

### Task 3: Core Module Tests
- [ ] Write unit tests for Game class
- [ ] Test Canvas management utilities
- [ ] Test InputManager functionality
- [ ] Test StateManager operations

### Task 4: Entity System Tests
- [ ] Test Entity base class functionality
- [ ] Test Player entity behavior
- [ ] Test secondary entities (Dog, Mouse, Fireball)
- [ ] Test Physics system calculations

### Task 5: CI/CD Integration
- [ ] Configure automated test runs
- [ ] Set up coverage reporting
- [ ] Add test result notifications
- [ ] Configure deployment gates

## Definition of Done

- [ ] Jest testing framework fully configured
- [ ] 80%+ overall test coverage achieved
- [ ] All critical modules have comprehensive unit tests
- [ ] Mock system enables isolated module testing
- [ ] CI/CD integration runs tests automatically
- [ ] Test suite runs in under 30 seconds
- [ ] Coverage reports generated and accessible
- [ ] Test documentation and guidelines created

## Dependencies

- Parallel development with Epic 1-4 modules
- Understanding of module interfaces and critical functionality

## Story Points Breakdown

- Jest setup and configuration: 1 point
- Mock system and test utilities: 1 point  
- Core module test implementation: 1.5 points
- CI/CD integration: 0.5 points

## Testing Strategy

- Test-driven development approach where possible
- Focus on critical game mechanics first
- Mock external dependencies consistently
- Verify edge cases and error conditions
- Maintain test performance for quick feedback loops
