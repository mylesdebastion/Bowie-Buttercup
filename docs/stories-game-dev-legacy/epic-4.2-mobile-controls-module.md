# US-018: Mobile Controls Module

**Story ID**: US-018  
**Epic**: [Epic 4: UI System Separation](../epics/epic-4-ui-system.md)  
**Story Points**: 4  
**Priority**: High  
**Sprint**: Week 3, Day 3  

## User Story

**As a** developer  
**I want** mobile controls modularized into their own system  
**So that** touch interface can be improved independently while maintaining exact responsiveness and feel  

## Business Value

Mobile controls are critical for accessibility and user experience on touch devices. Modularizing enables targeted improvements while preserving the carefully tuned touch responsiveness.

## Acceptance Criteria

### AC-001: Touch Control Responsiveness
- **Given** the mobile Controls module is active
- **When** I use touch controls on mobile device
- **Then** response timing and sensitivity match original exactly
- **And** D-pad functionality works identically to original
- **And** touch feedback and visual indicators are preserved

### AC-002: Input Integration
- **Given** mobile controls are modularized
- **When** they integrate with InputManager
- **Then** touch input is processed consistently with keyboard input
- **And** input normalization works correctly
- **And** no delay or lag is introduced in touch response

### AC-003: Visual Appearance
- **Given** the mobile control UI is rendered
- **When** displayed on various mobile devices
- **Then** D-pad appearance matches original exactly
- **And** button sizing and positioning are preserved
- **And** visual feedback for touches works correctly

### AC-004: Device Compatibility
- **Given** mobile controls are deployed
- **When** tested on target mobile devices
- **Then** iOS Safari compatibility is maintained
- **And** Android Chrome compatibility is preserved
- **And** various screen sizes work correctly

## Technical Tasks

### Task 1: Controls Module Architecture
- [ ] Extract Controls class from monolithic code
- [ ] Design clean interface for mobile control management
- [ ] Separate touch input handling from visual rendering
- [ ] Create modular component structure for controls

### Task 2: Touch Input Processing
- [ ] Extract touch event handling (touchstart, touchmove, touchend)
- [ ] Implement precise touch coordinate mapping
- [ ] Add multi-touch support for simultaneous inputs
- [ ] Preserve exact touch sensitivity and timing

### Task 3: D-Pad Rendering System
- [ ] Extract D-pad visual rendering code
- [ ] Implement D-pad button state visualization
- [ ] Add touch feedback and visual indicators
- [ ] Ensure pixel-perfect appearance matching original

### Task 4: Input Manager Integration
- [ ] Connect Controls module with InputManager
- [ ] Implement input normalization for touch events
- [ ] Add input state synchronization
- [ ] Test unified input processing across input types

### Task 5: Cross-Device Testing
- [ ] Test on various iOS devices and Safari versions
- [ ] Test on Android devices with Chrome
- [ ] Verify touch responsiveness across screen sizes
- [ ] Performance test on lower-end mobile devices

## Definition of Done

- [ ] Mobile controls work identically to original on all target devices
- [ ] Touch responsiveness and timing match exactly
- [ ] D-pad visual appearance is pixel-perfect
- [ ] Integration with InputManager is seamless
- [ ] No performance regression on mobile devices
- [ ] Cross-browser mobile compatibility verified
- [ ] Unit tests cover touch input processing
- [ ] Integration tests verify unified input handling

## Dependencies

- [US-004: Input Management System](../stories/epic-1.4-input-management.md) for input integration
- [US-003: Canvas Management Module](../stories/epic-1.3-canvas-management.md) for coordinate mapping
- Understanding of original mobile control implementation

## Story Points Breakdown

- Controls module extraction: 1.5 points
- Touch input processing: 1.5 points
- Integration and cross-device testing: 1 point

## Testing Strategy

- Unit tests for touch event processing and coordinate mapping
- Integration tests with InputManager for unified input
- Cross-device testing on iOS and Android platforms
- Touch responsiveness and timing verification tests
- Visual regression tests for D-pad appearance
- Performance testing on various mobile hardware
