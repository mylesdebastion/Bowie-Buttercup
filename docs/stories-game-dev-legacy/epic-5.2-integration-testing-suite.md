# US-022: Integration Testing Suite

**Story ID**: US-022  
**Epic**: [Epic 5: Testing and Quality Assurance](../epics/epic-5-testing-qa.md)  
**Story Points**: 4  
**Priority**: High  
**Sprint**: Week 3, parallel to integration  

## User Story

**As a** developer  
**I want** comprehensive integration tests for complete game flows  
**So that** the modular system works together correctly and game behavior matches the original exactly  

## Business Value

Integration tests ensure that modular components work together seamlessly and that the complete game experience matches the original implementation.

## Acceptance Criteria

### AC-001: Complete Game Flow Testing
- **Given** integration tests are implemented
- **When** testing complete gameplay scenarios
- **Then** all level progression paths are tested end-to-end
- **And** player interactions with entities work correctly
- **And** game state transitions are verified

### AC-002: Cross-Module Integration
- **Given** modules need to work together
- **When** integration tests run
- **Then** Entity-Physics integration is verified
- **And** Level-Entity interactions are tested
- **And** UI-Game state integration works correctly

### AC-003: Browser Environment Testing
- **Given** tests run in browser environment
- **When** testing Canvas and DOM interactions
- **Then** real browser APIs are used (not mocked)
- **And** actual game rendering is verified
- **And** input handling works in browser context

### AC-004: Performance Integration Testing
- **Given** integration tests measure performance
- **When** testing complete game scenarios
- **Then** performance benchmarks are verified
- **And** frame rate consistency is tested
- **And** memory usage during gameplay is monitored

## Technical Tasks

### Task 1: Integration Test Framework
- [ ] Set up Puppeteer or Playwright for browser testing
- [ ] Configure integration test environment
- [ ] Create test utilities for game simulation
- [ ] Set up visual regression testing capabilities

### Task 2: Level Progression Tests
- [ ] Create tests for Level 1 completion flow
- [ ] Test Level 2 mouse catching mechanics
- [ ] Test Level 3 challenge navigation
- [ ] Test Level 4-5 final progression

### Task 3: Entity Interaction Tests
- [ ] Test Player-Dog collision scenarios
- [ ] Test Player-Mouse catching mechanics
- [ ] Test Player-Fireball collision accuracy
- [ ] Test entity spawning and lifecycle management

### Task 4: System Integration Tests
- [ ] Test InputManager-Entity integration
- [ ] Test StateManager persistence across levels
- [ ] Test UI component integration with game state
- [ ] Test Canvas rendering with all game systems

### Task 5: Performance Integration Tests
- [ ] Create performance benchmark tests
- [ ] Test frame rate consistency during gameplay
- [ ] Test memory usage patterns
- [ ] Set up performance regression detection

## Definition of Done

- [ ] Complete game flow tests cover all level progression paths
- [ ] Cross-module integration tests verify system interactions
- [ ] Browser environment tests use real APIs and rendering
- [ ] Performance integration tests establish benchmarks
- [ ] Integration tests catch regressions in game behavior
- [ ] Test suite provides clear failure diagnostics
- [ ] Visual regression tests verify game appearance
- [ ] Integration tests run reliably in CI/CD environment

## Dependencies

- [US-021: Unit Testing Framework](epic-5.1-unit-testing-framework.md) foundation
- Epic 1-4 modules must be integrated and functional
- Understanding of original game behavior for comparison

## Story Points Breakdown

- Integration test framework setup: 1.5 points
- Level progression and entity tests: 2 points
- Performance and system integration tests: 0.5 points

## Testing Strategy

- End-to-end testing of critical game flows
- Visual regression testing for UI consistency
- Performance regression testing for optimization validation
- Cross-browser integration testing on target platforms
- Real browser environment testing for accuracy
