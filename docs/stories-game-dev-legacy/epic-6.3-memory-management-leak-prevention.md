# US-027: Memory Management and Leak Prevention

**Story ID**: US-027  
**Epic**: [Epic 6: Performance and Optimization](../epics/epic-6-performance-optimization.md)  
**Story Points**: 2  
**Priority**: Medium  
**Sprint**: Week 3, Day 5  

## User Story

**As a** developer  
**I want** robust memory management with leak prevention  
**So that** the game can run for extended periods without performance degradation or crashes  

## Business Value

Proper memory management ensures stable long-term gameplay and prevents memory-related performance issues that could degrade user experience.

## Acceptance Criteria

### AC-001: Memory Usage Optimization
- **Given** the game is optimized for memory usage
- **When** measuring memory consumption during gameplay
- **Then** memory usage remains under 50MB on mobile devices
- **And** memory usage is comparable or better than original implementation
- **And** memory growth patterns are stable over time

### AC-002: Memory Leak Prevention
- **Given** memory leak prevention is implemented
- **When** playing the game for extended periods
- **Then** no memory leaks are detected in entity management
- **And** level transitions don't cause memory accumulation
- **And** UI components clean up properly when destroyed

### AC-003: Garbage Collection Optimization
- **Given** garbage collection patterns are optimized
- **When** the game runs continuously
- **Then** object allocation is minimized during gameplay loops
- **And** garbage collection pauses don't cause frame drops
- **And** object pooling reduces allocation pressure where beneficial

### AC-004: Resource Cleanup
- **Given** resources need proper cleanup
- **When** transitioning between game states or levels
- **Then** all resources are properly released
- **And** event listeners and subscriptions are cleaned up
- **And** Canvas contexts and DOM references are managed properly
