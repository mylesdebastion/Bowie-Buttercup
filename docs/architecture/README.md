## Architecture Summary

### System Type
Browser-based 2D platformer game with modular vanilla JavaScript architecture

### Key Architectural Patterns
- **Entity-Component System**: Game objects with compositional behavior
- **Observer Pattern**: Event-driven communication between modules
- **Module Pattern**: ES6 modules with explicit interfaces
- **State Management**: Centralized state with immutable updates
- **Factory Pattern**: Dynamic entity and level creation

### Core Principles
- **100% Backward Compatibility**: Preserve all existing functionality
- **Performance First**: 60 FPS target with memory optimization
- **Modular Design**: Clear separation of concerns and responsibilities
- **Testability**: Comprehensive unit and integration testing
- **Maintainability**: Self-documenting code with consistent patterns

### Technology Constraints
- **Vanilla JavaScript Only**: No framework dependencies
- **ES6+ Features**: Modern JavaScript without transpilation
- **Single File Deployment**: Self-contained HTML output
- **Browser Compatibility**: Chrome 90+, Firefox 88+, Safari 14+, Edge 90+

## Architecture Evolution

### Current Phase: Modularization (Weeks 1-3)
Transform monolithic 3,400+ line HTML file into modular architecture

**Week 1**: Foundation (Core systems, build pipeline)
**Week 2**: Entity system (Game objects, physics, collision)
**Week 3**: UI and levels (Interface components, level management)

### Near-term (3-6 months)
- Performance optimization and monitoring
- Enhanced development tooling
- Additional game content and mechanics

### Medium-term (6-12 months)
- Framework migration preparation (Phaser 3 compatibility)
- Advanced features (level editor, sprite improvements)
- Multiplayer architecture foundations

### Long-term (1+ years)
- Plugin system for extensibility
- Community content support
- Cross-platform deployment options

## Quality Attributes

### Performance Targets
- **60 FPS** maintained on all supported devices
- **<50MB** memory usage on mobile devices  
- **<200KB** bundle size (gzipped)
- **<2 seconds** loading time on 3G connections

### Reliability Requirements
- **Zero tolerance** for game-breaking bugs
- **Graceful degradation** for unsupported features
- **State recovery** from corruption or errors
- **Cross-browser consistency** across supported platforms

### Maintainability Goals
- **80%+ test coverage** for critical game mechanics
- **100% JSDoc coverage** for public APIs
- **Modular architecture** enabling parallel development
- **Clear upgrade paths** for future enhancements

## Document Maintenance

### Review Schedule
- **Weekly Reviews**: During active development phases
- **Monthly Reviews**: Post-deployment maintenance
- **Quarterly Reviews**: Architecture evolution planning
- **Annual Reviews**: Major version planning and technology assessment

### Change Management
