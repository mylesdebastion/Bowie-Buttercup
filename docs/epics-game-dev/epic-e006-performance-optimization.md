# Epic 6: Performance and Optimization

**Epic ID**: EPIC-006  
**Epic Goal**: Optimize modular architecture for production deployment  
**Business Value**: Ensure modularization doesn't degrade performance while enabling future optimizations  
**Story Points**: 8  
**Duration**: Week 3, Day 5  

## Epic Overview

This epic focuses on optimizing the modular architecture to meet or exceed the original performance benchmarks while establishing monitoring and optimization capabilities for future development.

## Success Criteria

- Performance equals or exceeds original monolithic version
- Bundle size optimized and within target limits
- Loading times improved through code splitting
- Performance monitoring integrated for ongoing optimization
- Memory usage optimized with leak prevention

## User Stories

1. [US-025: Bundle Size Optimization](../stories/epic-6.1-bundle-size-optimization.md)
2. [US-026: Runtime Performance Optimization](../stories/epic-6.2-runtime-performance-optimization.md)  
3. [US-027: Memory Management and Leak Prevention](../stories/epic-6.3-memory-management-leak-prevention.md)
4. [US-028: Performance Monitoring Integration](../stories/epic-6.4-performance-monitoring-integration.md)

## Dependencies

- **Epic 1-4**: All modular architecture must be completed
- **Epic 5**: Performance testing framework must be operational
- Baseline performance metrics from original implementation

## Risks

- Performance optimization complexity
- Bundle optimization breaking functionality  
- Memory optimization affecting game behavior
- Performance monitoring overhead

## Definition of Epic Done

- Performance metrics equal or exceed original benchmarks
- Bundle size meets target specifications (<200KB gzipped)
- Memory usage optimized with no leaks detected
- Performance monitoring provides actionable insights
- Production build ready for deployment with optimal performance
