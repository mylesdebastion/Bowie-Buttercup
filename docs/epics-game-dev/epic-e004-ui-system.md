# Epic 4: UI System Separation

**Epic ID**: EPIC-004  
**Epic Goal**: Modularize all user interface components  
**Business Value**: Enable independent UI development and easier enhancement of user experience features  
**Story Points**: 15  
**Duration**: Week 3, Days 3-4  

## Epic Overview

This epic separates all user interface components into independent modules, including the sprite editor, mobile controls, settings panel, and HUD elements. This enables focused UI improvements while maintaining the exact user experience.

## Success Criteria

- Sprite editor functionality preserved with modular architecture
- Mobile controls work identically with touch responsiveness  
- Settings panel maintains all original features and persistence
- HUD elements render correctly and efficiently
- UI components integrate seamlessly with game systems

## User Stories

## Definition of Epic Done

- All UI components function identically to original
- Touch controls maintain exact responsiveness  
- Sprite editor preserves full functionality
- Settings panel integrates with state management
- UI system ready for Testing and Performance optimization (Epics 5 & 6)
