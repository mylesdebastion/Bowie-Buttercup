# Epic 3: Level System Architecture

**Epic ID**: EPIC-003  
**Epic Goal**: Convert levels to modular, extensible system  
**Business Value**: Enable independent level development and easy addition of new levels  
**Story Points**: 18  
**Duration**: Week 3, Days 1-2  

## Epic Overview

This epic transforms the hardcoded level system into a modular architecture where each level is its own module with a standardized interface. This enables independent level development, easier testing, and the foundation for future level editor capabilities.

## Success Criteria

- All 5 levels extracted to independent modules with identical functionality
- Level management system supports dynamic loading and transitions
- Level-specific mechanics (dog bouncing, mouse spawning) preserved exactly
- Level progression system works identically to original
- Foundation ready for easy addition of new levels

## Dependencies

- **Epic 2**: Entity System Modularization must be completed
- All entity modules must be operational and tested

## Risks

- Level-specific mechanics breaking during extraction
- Level transition timing and smoothness
- Complex level state management requirements
- Performance impact of modular level loading

## Definition of Epic Done

- All 5 levels function identically to original implementation
- Level transitions work smoothly without interruption
- Level-specific entity behaviors preserved exactly  
- Level system ready for UI System integration (Epic 4)
