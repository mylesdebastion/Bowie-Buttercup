# Planning Documentation - PetPixel Games Platform

This directory contains all planning artifacts for the PetPixel Games platform development.

## Core Planning Documents

### Requirements & Strategy
- **[PRD - Web Platform](./prd-web-platform.md)** - Complete product requirements for web platform
- **[Architecture - Web Platform](./architecture-web-platform.md)** - Technical architecture and system design
- **[Frontend Spec - Web Platform](./frontend-spec-web-platform.md)** - UX/UI specifications and user flows

### Business Planning
- **[Project Brief](../bmad/pet-game-platform-brief.md)** - Business case and market analysis
- **[Revenue Model](./revenue-strategy.md)** - Pricing strategy and financial projections
- **[Go-to-Market Strategy](./gtm-strategy.md)** - Launch plan and user acquisition

## Planning Status

âœ… **Complete**: PRD, Architecture, Frontend Spec validated through BMad methodology  
ðŸŽ¯ **Current Phase**: Begin implementation with Epic E001 (User Auth)  
ðŸ“‹ **Strategy**: Manual pixel art for first 20 users to accelerate profitability  

## Key Decisions Made

### Technical Architecture
- **Monorepo Structure**: Start with single repo, evolve to multi-repo
- **Web Platform Stack**: Next.js + Node.js + PostgreSQL + Stripe
- **Game Architecture**: Lean templates with JSON-driven content
- **Manual Phase**: Human pixel art creation for first 20 customers

### Development Approach
- **8 Web Platform Epics**: Structured development in 3 phases
- **6 Game Development Epics**: Separate from platform development
- **Testing Strategy**: Comprehensive QA with high-risk area focus
- **Performance Targets**: <3 minute game generation, 99.9% uptime

## Implementation Roadmap

### Phase 1: Web Platform Foundation (4-6 weeks)

## Validation Status

All planning documents have passed:
- **BMad Methodology Validation**: Complete workflow followed
- **PO Master Checklist**: All criteria met (9/10 confidence)
- **QA Risk Assessment**: High-risk areas identified and mitigated
- **Architecture Review**: Technical feasibility confirmed

## Next Steps

1. **Begin Development**: Start with Epic E001 (User Authentication)
2. **Setup Infrastructure**: Initialize monorepo structure
3. **Design Assets**: Create brand identity and UI components
4. **Artist Workflow**: Establish manual pixel art creation process
