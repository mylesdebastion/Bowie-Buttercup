# Epic E002: Entity System Modularization - COMPLETION SUMMARY

**Epic ID**: EPIC-002  
**Status**: ✅ COMPLETE  
**Completion Date**: 2025-08-27  
**Story Points**: 29  

## 🎯 Epic Overview

Successfully transformed the monolithic entity system from Game.js into a modular, extensible architecture. All game entities (Player, Dog, Mouse, Fireball, Particle) have been extracted into independent modules with a shared base class, while the physics system became a separate, testable module.

## ✅ Success Criteria Achievement
